Squall
======
Audio engine for games. Originally written by Marat Gilyazetdinov. Last version of the engine was 1.48, then, in 2009, Squall was open-sourced. Since then, the progect is no longer maintained by the original developers, so I decided to publish it on GitHub. I plan to modernize the code base and port the engine to Linux, add OSS or ALSA support. So far I haven't modified anything, just transcoded all the files into UTF-8.

Features
--------
* Written in C++, has also C interface
* Supports WAV, MP3, WMA, OGG/Vorbis and a variety of tracker formats including MOD, S3M, XM, IT and many others
* Output via DirectSound
* 3D sound support

There's also a rumor that a strongly modified version of Squall had become a part of X-Ray, the engine of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Not sure if it's true.
